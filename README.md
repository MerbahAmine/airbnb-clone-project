#Technology Stack
This project uses a robust, industry-standard technology stack to build a scalable and secure Airbnb-like platform. Below is a breakdown of each technology and its role in the application.
Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build secure, maintainable, and scalable backend services. It handles routing, request/response cycles, and integrates well with authentication and ORM systems.

Django REST Framework (DRF)
A powerful toolkit built on Django for creating RESTful APIs. It provides features like serialization, authentication, and API views for building and consuming resources.
Database
PostgreSQL
A powerful, open-source relational database used to store structured application data such as users, bookings, listings, and reviews. Chosen for its performance, reliability, and support for complex queries.
API Layer
GraphQL (optional)
A query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries. It allows clients to request only the data they need and supports more efficient front-end development (optional depending on project scope).
 Authentication & Security
Django Auth
Built-in Django authentication system used for managing users, login/logout functionality, permissions, and session management.

Django Allauth / JWT
Additional packages for enabling third-party logins (Google, Facebook) and token-based authentication.

DevOps & Deployment
Git & GitHub
Version control system and cloud-based repository platform for collaboration and source code management.

Gunicorn & Nginx
Gunicorn is a Python WSGI HTTP server used to serve Django applications in production. Nginx acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer.

Docker 
Containerization platform used for packaging the application into lightweight, portable containers for consistent development and production environments.

## Feature Breakdown
The Airbnb Clone Project includes a range of core features that replicate key functionality of real-world booking platforms. Each feature is designed to enhance user experience, streamline operations, and ensure data integrity across the application.

üë§ User Management
Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. The system includes authentication, password encryption, and role-based access to distinguish between guests and hosts.

üè† Property Management
Hosts can list new properties by adding details like title, description, location, pricing, and images. They can also update or delete their listings, giving them full control over their property offerings.

üìÖ Booking System
Guests can view available properties, select dates, and make bookings in real time. The system checks for date availability and calculates total costs before confirming reservations.

‚úçÔ∏è Reviews and Ratings
Users can leave ratings and feedback on properties they‚Äôve booked. This feature helps build trust between hosts and guests and promotes transparency on the platform.

üí≥ Payment Integration
A secure payment workflow is integrated, allowing guests to pay for bookings using different methods. Payment status (e.g., pending, completed) is tracked for accountability and transaction history.

üîç Property Search and Filtering
Users can search for properties by location, price range, and availability. This feature improves usability by helping guests find suitable listings quickly and efficiently.

üîê Authentication & Authorization
The application enforces secure login and access controls. Admin actions (like deleting a listing) are restricted to owners, ensuring data privacy and security.

## API Security

‚úÖ Authentication
Description: Ensures that only registered users can access the platform using secure login methods (e.g., Django‚Äôs auth system or JWT).

Why It‚Äôs Important: Protects user accounts from unauthorized access and helps enforce identity validation for actions like booking or listing properties.

‚úÖ Authorization
Description: Controls what actions each user role (guest, host, admin) can perform based on permissions.

Why It‚Äôs Important: Prevents users from accessing or modifying data they don't own (e.g., updating another user‚Äôs property or payment record).

‚úÖ Rate Limiting
Description: Limits the number of requests a user or IP address can make within a specific time frame.

Why It‚Äôs Important: Mitigates brute-force attacks, abuse of APIs, and protects the system from overload.

‚úÖ Input Validation and Sanitization
Description: Validates all incoming data to prevent malicious input such as SQL injection or XSS attacks.

Why It‚Äôs Important: Ensures the backend only processes safe, expected data, thereby safeguarding the application and database.

‚úÖ HTTPS & Secure Headers
Description: Enforces HTTPS communication and sets security headers like Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options.

Why It‚Äôs Important: Protects data during transmission and reduces exposure to common web-based attacks.

‚úÖ Password Hashing
Description: Uses hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) to store passwords securely.

Why It‚Äôs Important: Ensures that if the database is ever compromised, user passwords are not readable in plain text.

‚úÖ Secure Payment Processing
Description: All payment transactions are handled through secure, PCI-compliant providers with tokenization and encryption.

Why It‚Äôs Important: Protects users' financial data and prevents fraudulent transactions.

‚úÖ CSRF Protection
Description: Implements CSRF tokens on forms and authenticated requests.

Why It‚Äôs Important: Prevents attackers from forging requests on behalf of authenticated users.

## CI/CD Pipeline 

What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery. It is a development practice that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code. Whenever new changes are pushed to the repository, the CI/CD pipeline ensures they are automatically verified and deployed, maintaining code quality and minimizing manual errors.

Why CI/CD is Important
üß™ Automated Testing: Ensures code quality and prevents bugs from reaching production.

üöÄ Faster Deployment: Automates deployment processes to staging and production environments.

üîÑ Consistent Integration: Integrates changes continuously to avoid merge conflicts and stale code.

üîí Improved Security: Incorporates static analysis and security checks before deployment.

Tools Used
GitHub Actions: Automates workflows like testing, linting, and deployment on every push or pull request.

Docker: Containerizes the application for consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

pytest / unittest: Used for backend test automation to validate functionality on each code update.
